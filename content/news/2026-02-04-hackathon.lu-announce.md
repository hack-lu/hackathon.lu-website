The [hack.lu](https://hack.lu/) team and [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/) announce the new hackathon.lu 2026 event. 

## hackathon.lu 2026: Open Source, Security, and Collaboration — with an Open Conference Morning on 14 April

**Luxembourg, April 2026** — hackathon.lu returns on **14–15 April 2026**, bringing together developers, security professionals, researchers, and Open Source enthusiasts for two days of hands-on collaboration, experimentation, and knowledge sharing in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

Designed as a **community-driven Open Source hackathon**, hackathon.lu focuses on building, improving, and challenging real-world tools and ideas — particularly in the areas of security, engineering, and interoperability. The event welcomes participants of all backgrounds, from experienced practitioners to curious newcomers.

## A Conference Morning to Kick Things Off

To open the event, hackathon.lu will host an **integrated conference morning** on **Tuesday, 14 April 2026, from 09:00 to 12:00**.

This **informal, breakfast-style conference** is **open to the public** and brings together speakers from Open Source and security communities to share short, focused talks. Rather than polished product pitches, the emphasis is on **practical experience, lessons learned, and ideas that invite collaboration**.

The conference morning is designed to:
- Set the tone for the hackathon
- Spark discussion and cross-pollination of ideas
- Inspire projects that participants can explore during the hackathon itself

## From Ideas to Action

Following the conference morning, registered hackathon participants will spend the remainder of **14–15 April** working in small, self-organizing teams on Open Source projects, prototypes, tooling, documentation, and experiments.

There is no pressure to “finish” — learning, collaboration, and shared progress are the primary goals.

## Open, Inclusive, and Community-Focused

hackathon.lu is built around the values of:
- Open Source and open collaboration
- Knowledge sharing over competition
- Practical, real-world engineering
- Building bridges between communities

The event is closely aligned with the spirit of **hack.lu**, Luxembourg’s long-standing security conference.
