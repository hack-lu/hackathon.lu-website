# Register a new project

During sign-up you can select from a list of projects or suggest a new project.
To prepare for the hackathon and attract more people to contribute, you can already add your projects and tasks on the [website via a PR:](https://github.com/hack-lu/hackathon.lu-website)

The idea behind the concept of tasks is to provide visibility to potential contributors and help other projects to identify possible collaboration opportunities, even before the actual hackathon starts.

It would be great if you could add tasks or ideas for tasks related to your specific projects, as well as potential interactions with other projects.

Don't hesitate to ask as for support if needed.
