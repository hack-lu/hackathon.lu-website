[Pandora](https://github.com/pandora-analysis/pandora) is an analysis framework to discover if a file is suspicious and conveniently show the results.

### Vulnerability-Lookup

![](/images/projects/vulnerability-lookup-logo.jpg)

[Vulnerability-Lookup](https://www.vulnerability-lookup.org) facilitates quick correlation of vulnerabilities from various sources, independent of vulnerability IDs, and streamlines the management of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD).

### VulnTrain

[VulnTrain](https://github.com/vulnerability-lookup/VulnTrain) is a tool for generating diverse datasets and models using vulnerability data from Vulnerability-Lookup.

It leverages all vulnerability advisory sources supported by Vulnerability-Lookup to train models, utilizing over one million JSON records.
Additionally, data from the ``vulnerability-lookup:meta`` container, including enrichment sources such as ``vulnrichment`` and ``Fraunhofer FKIE``, is incorporated to enhance model quality.

Various models are already [available on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/CIRCL) and we are always interested in new ideas (datasets, trainers, integration with Vulnerability-Lookup, ...)!

### OISF and Suricata

[cocktailparty](https://github.com/flowintel/CocktailParty) is a websocket data brocker system based on the [phoenix framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/).

### Mercator

![](/images/projects/logo4c.png) 

[Mercator](https://github.com/dbarzin/mercator) is a powerful and versatile open-source web application designed to facilitate the mapping of information systems, as outlined in the [Mapping The Information System Guide](https://cyber.gouv.fr/en/publications/mapping-information-system) by [ANSSI](https://cyber.gouv.fr/en). Whether you're an operator of vital importance or part of a broader IT governance framework, Mercator is an essential tool for gaining visibility, control, and ensuring the resilience of your information systems.

### sysdiagnose analysis framework

![](/images/projects/sysdiagnose-logo.png)

[sysdiagnose](https://github.com/EC-DIGIT-CSIRC/sysdiagnose) is an open-source framework developed to facilitate the analysis of the Apple sysdiagnose files and especially the one generated on mobile devices (iOS / iPadOS).  In the light of targeted attacks against journalists, activist, representatives from the civil society and politicians, it empowered incident response team to review device behaviour and ensure their integrity.  This tool is initially the result of a joint effort between EC DIGIT CSOC (European Commission DG DIGIT) and CERT-EU (https://cert.europa.eu/).

### YALTF (Yet Another License Tool and Framework)

![YALTF (Yet Another License Tool and Framework)](/images/projects/yaltf.png)

[YALTF](https://github.com/yaltf/yaltf)  is a tool designed to scan and gather software licenses across multiple remote systems. It connects to target systems via SSH and collects information about installed packages and their associated licenses. It features Remote system scanning via SSH, Parallel scanning of multiple targets, Support for CentOS, Fedora, RHEL (Rocky) and OpenSUSE, Structured JSON output. This tool was initially developed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in collaboration with Cortex Security S.A.

### IDPS-ESCAPE

![IDPS-ESCAPE logo](/images/projects/idps-escape-logo.png)

[IDPS-ESCAPE](https://github.com/AbstractionsLab/idps-escape) (Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems for Evading Supply Chain Attacks and Post-compromise Effects), part of project [CyFORT](https://abstractionslab.com/index.php/research-and-development/cyfort/), is an open-source SOAR system powered by a dedicated anomaly detection toolbox (**ADBox**), integrated with open-source software such as Wazuh and Suricata. The ADBox provides an extensible framework for integrating different AD algorithms and currently includes an implementation of MTAD-GAT, a Multivariate Time-series Anomaly Detection (MTAD) algorithm relying on Graph Attention Networks (GAT).

### SATRAP

![SATRAP logo](/images/projects/satrap-logo.png)

[SATRAP](https://github.com/AbstractionsLab/satrap-dl) (Semi-Automated Threat Reconnaissance and Analysis Platform) part of project [CyFORT](https://abstractionslab.com/index.php/research-and-development/cyfort/), is an open-source, cross-platform software aimed at supporting computer-aided analysis of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) by leveraging automated reasoning and inference. At its core, SATRAP implements a knowledge representation system (KRS) consisting of a CTI knowledge base coupled with a reasoning engine for inferring new knowledge, built on top of TypeDB. The KRS grounds SATRAP into formal underpinnings, enabling the introduction of semantics into the storage, processing, and analysis of CTI.
