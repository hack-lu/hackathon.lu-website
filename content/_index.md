This **2-day physical Hackathon, held in Luxembourg on April 14th and 15th, 2026 (9:00–17:00)**, combines a hands-on Open Source hackathon with an **integrated, public conference morning** on April 14th (09:00–12:00). The event focuses on the development of free and open-source software for cybersecurity and related domains. We aim to bring together diverse developer and practitioner communities to collaborate on real-world challenges across key cybersecurity areas, including information sharing, threat intelligence, network and system forensics, data mining, network and computer exploitation, and defense techniques. The objectives include strengthening and extending existing [open-source security projects](/projects/), improving interoperability and integration between tools, and enabling the emergence of innovative new solutions.

The hackathon emphasizes [tackling complex challenges](/topics/), whether by enhancing existing projects or initiating new ones, with a strong focus on how **in-person collaboration and early idea exchange**—starting with the conference morning—can help overcome practical and organizational obstacles. Participants are encouraged to engage both before and after the event to maximize productivity and long-term impact. The goal is to foster collaboration across established and emerging projects while building trust and shared ownership within Open Source communities.
