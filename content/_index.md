This **2-day physical Hackathon, held in Luxembourg on April 8th and 9th, 2025 (9:00-17:00)**, focuses on the development of free and open-source software for cybersecurity. We aim to convene diverse developer groups to collaborate on complex programming challenges within key cybersecurity areas, such as information sharing, threat intelligence, network and system forensics, data mining, network and computer exploitation, and defense techniques. The hackathonâ€™s objectives include improving existing [open-source security projects](/projects/), enhancing interoperability and integration between different security tools, and driving the creation of innovative new solutions.

The hackathon will emphasize [tackling complex challenges](/topics/), whether by enhancing existing projects or creating new ones, with a focus on how in-person collaboration and interaction can help overcome specific obstacles. We encourage activities both before and after the hackathon to maximize productivity and ensure the event is a catalyst for impactful progress. We aim to foster collaboration with both existing and new projects while building stronger trust within collaborative groups.
